# AnimetoWebDesign
It is easier for vendors  for marketing purpose also they can add subscription on weekly, monthly and even yearly basis. The customers also who are students and working professional staying away from home need not worry about searching for good quality homemade food. They can easily find several options on the website as per their choice.



# Project Description 

It is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
For completion of this website we have used some of the core azure services such as Static Webapps, Visual Studio Code.

Deployment can be viewed here:https://brave-water-074827500.1.azurestaticapps.net/


For deploying a static webapp using Azure Static web app service we have to make a resource group in my case it was "AnimetoFood" and connect to github account in order to access repositories. Azure creates a github actions .yaml file in ".github/Workflows/ " which automatically detects a new commit and run a github actions workflow and the changes reflects on the actual website.
